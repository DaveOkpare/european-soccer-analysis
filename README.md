<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The project focuses on the soccer database comes from Kaggle and it iss well suited for data analysis and machine learning. It contains data for soccer matches, players, and teams from several European countries from 2008 to 2016.

 - The database is stored in a SQLite database. I have extracted the dataset using the OpenDataset library which downloads the dataset from Kaggle.

 - You can obtain API token from Kaggle to download the dataset from this notebook.

 - Related tables in the dataset are merged together using SQL joins.

 - Some column titles should be self-explanatory, and others you’ll have to look up the dataset source for more information.
